## My personal website
# _________________
So ummm I had an idea one day for a personal website without any JS knowledge but a pretty moderate HTML + CSS experience
(I still need to learn JS lmao)
So thats basically what I did and I think it turned out great
#### BUT THEN
It turned into a blog which I basically never used, so I scrapped that idea and here we are now.
****(THIS WEBSITE IS NOT MOBILE OPTIMIZED.)****
If I knew how to make this mobile friendly, I would, but sadly, I kinda suck at coding lol
If you would like to contribute to this website and add mobile support and maybe a few other things, I would greatly appreciate it.
This website *IS* open source, you can fork this if you want if you want to build off of it, You shouldn't have too many problems with
trying to read it, my coding is usually pretty traditional and basic.

Anyways thanks for reading this lol
